# Development Proposal: Daikibo Factory Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

This proposal outlines the development of a comprehensive industrial IoT dashboard solution for Daikibo Corporation's factory monitoring requirements. The system will provide real-time health status monitoring for 36 machines across 4 manufacturing facilities, accessible exclusively within the company's secure intranet environment.

The dashboard will integrate with Daikibo's existing internal authentication infrastructure, enabling seamless access for authorized personnel using their corporate credentials. This solution emphasizes reliability, security, and user experience while maintaining the highest standards of industrial monitoring.
